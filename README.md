## Patatap Project

- This is a fullstack project. The frontend code is made using: HTML, CSS and Javascript (using PaperJs and HowlerJs). The backend for this project was done in Python using the Flask framework.
- It works by pressing any of the letters keys on the keyboard, which will produce varying sounds
- The key presses will also produce varying colored circles that appear and disappear on the screen at different positions 

The backend server can be started by running the code:
```bash 
$ python app.py
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
